# Specification Quality Checklist: Dead Time Inner Circle

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-09-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation pass 1 (2026-09-25): All items passed after clarifying FR-006 (text talk MUST; short meet SHOULD) and documenting MVP talk assumptions.
- Full third-party chat fork evaluation remains a product/planning choice, not part of this spec's functional requirements.
- Ready for `/speckit-clarify` (optional) or `/speckit-plan`.
